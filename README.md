<summary><strong>📊 Sales & Profitability Analysis — Margin Leakage & Discount Governance </strong></summary>

---

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project delivers an end-to-end profitability deep dive on a **$2.2M+ sales transaction dataset**, focused on evaluating **pricing effectiveness** and uncovering the *true order-level profit performance*.  

Instead of stopping at revenue metrics, the analysis isolates **where and why the business is losing money**, enabling data-backed pricing control and margin protection.

---

## 🚀 Key Insights & Business Impact  

### 🔻 Margin Leakage Detection  
Approximately **20% of total orders** were found to generate a **negative contribution margin**, directly eroding overall profitability.

### 🎯 Root Cause Analysis  
The primary driver of loss-making transactions was traced to **uncontrolled discounting patterns** across specific product and customer segments.

### ⚠️ Risk Mitigation  
A **Power BI dashboard** was developed to provide **real-time visibility** into:
- High-risk orders  
- Discount impact on margins  
- Profitability trends over time  

### 🏛️ Strategic Governance  
The analysis framework was structured into performance monitoring metrics that support **executive-level pricing governance** and **discount policy enforcement**.

## 🛠️ Technical Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Processing (SQL)  
- Used **CTEs** and **Window Functions** to calculate **order-level contribution margins**  
- Ranked customer and product segments by profitability  
- Conducted **discount band analysis** across multiple business dimensions  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)  
- Leveraged **Pandas** for pricing effectiveness analysis  
- Performed segmentation to identify margin risk clusters  
- Conducted trend and distribution analysis for discount behavior  

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization (Power BI)  
- Engineered KPIs to monitor:
  - Margin risk  
  - Discount exposure  
  - Profit performance trends  
- Built visual reports showing the correlation between **high discount rates** and **negative margin outcomes**

## 📂 Repository Structure  

```
/SQL_Queries        → Profitability logic, KPI calculations, margin analysis  
/Python_Notebooks   → EDA, segmentation, pricing effectiveness analysis  
/Dashboards         → Power BI files and visualization assets  
```

## 📈 Business Relevance  

This project directly supports:

- **Margin Protection**  
- **Discount Governance**  
- **Pricing Strategy Optimization**  
- **Sales Performance Analysis**

The outcome ensures that revenue growth is **profitable, controlled, and sustainable**, not driven by margin-destructive discounting.
